        <p>
          I'm an aspiring software developer looking for work. I started programming
          as hobby in 2016, beginning with Ruby on Rails. Almost a year ago, I started
          a full-stack Javascript binge which hasn't abated. Recently, I've spent
          most of my time buiding stuff with React, but I have an unreasonable
          willingness to learn more, whether it be front-end or back-end tech.
